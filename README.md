# Firebase-DB

Firebase Realtime database is a cloud hosted databse that supports multiple platforms (Android, iOS and Web).
All the data is stored in JSON format and any changes in data, reflects immediately by performing sync across all platforms and devices. This allows us to build more flexible realtime apps easily with minimal effort.

Used FirebaseUI to easy working with firebase to display data.
